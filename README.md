# Nand2Tetris

Disclaimer: I don't think I will have the time to proof-read my writing in this and other READMEs. If I make typos or grammatical errors, please feel free to correct me through PRs. If my writing is not clear or easy to understand, I am really sorry, and feel free to suggest changes as well.

## About this repo

In this repo I will upload my submissions for the nand2tetris course I am doing for future reference. The repo is split into two parts. The first part corresponds to the first nand2tetris course where we build hardware, and the second part corresponds to the second part of the course where we build the software stack. Each of these parts are then broken down into modules where each module has a graded practical project. I will keep track of my submissions in this repo and I will also try to write-up on any key-learnings in the READMEs of each project.

## About the course

Nand2Tetris is a course by Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan that aims to teach the learner how a computer works from first principles. In this course we are taught how to build a computer capable of running tetris starting with simple NAND gates. The course is in two parts.

### Part 1

[Course on Courseera](https://www.coursera.org/programs/bel-students-learning-program-wopnh/learn/build-a-computer)  
In the first part, we build the hardware, starting from NAND gates, and working our way up to a full computer capable of running a machine language defined within the course. We will also build an assembler so we do not have to write actual binary when programming the computer.

### Part 2

[Course on Courseera](https://www.coursera.org/programs/bel-students-learning-program-wopnh/learn/nand2tetris2)  
In the second part, we build the software stack for the computer. This stack will include a virtual machine, a language compiler, and an operating system.

## Motivation

- Much of the coding I have been doing right now has been high-level and involved application software. By doing this course, I hope to learn parts of the computer I have been treating like black boxes. Things like how the hardware actually works, how a compiler works, how input/output works, what an operating system really is. Those are the questions I hope to answer. So far, what I have covered in Part 1 has been very fascinating. I am looking forward to learning more in Part 2-especially building a compiler.
